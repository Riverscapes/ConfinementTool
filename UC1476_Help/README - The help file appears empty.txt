1] Read this file first before you do anything!

2] Download the CHM file to anywhere on your C:\ drive. It has to be on your C:\ drive to work, so placing it on a network drive fill fail.

3] Read [2] again I said C:\ drive!

4] Standard security settings of Windows mean that the CHM is blocked because Windows knows its not from your machine. 
   Don't know why this happens but it means that the file appears blank when you open it.

5] To unblock the CHM file go to file explorer locate the CHM file, then right click on it and go to properties. Under the general tab
   you will see a UNBLOCK button, click on that to unblock it then press OK. You will only ever need to do this once.

6] To open the CHM file simply double click on it
