### Stand-Alone Tools
The primary Confinement Tools can also be used in a "stand-alone" analysis workflow. 

- **[Confining Margins Tool](Generate-Confining-Margins)** Generate confining margins and calculate Confinement values for a stream network.
- **[Confinement By Segments](Calculating-Confinement)** Calculate confinement along *pre-existing* segments in the stream network.
- **[Moving Window Tool](MovingWindowTool)** Tool for calculating confinement from a set of moving window segments.
